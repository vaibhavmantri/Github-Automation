# First-Automation-Python
<h3> This is my first automation porject with python.
<h3>In this I've created an automation system for Github where a user can enter their username or email and password.
<h3>Then it asks for whether they want to create a new repository. If yes, User can type the desired name of the repository and thus the repository is created.
